## 🔗 Connection to Python Script

The app reads from `etf_analysis_20251022.json`, which is generated by your Python ETF analyzer. To update:

```bash
cd "ETF 10:22:25"
python3 etf_dividend_analyzer.py
cp etf_analysis_YYYYMMDD.json ../DividendETFTracker/DividendETFTracker/
```

Then update the filename in `ETFDataManager.swift` line 17.

## ✨ Architecture

**MVVM Pattern**
- **Models**: `ETFData.swift`, `ETFDataManager.swift`
- **Views**: `ContentView.swift`, `ETFDetailView.swift`
- **App**: `DividendETFTrackerApp.swift`

**Data Flow**
1. ETFDataManager loads JSON from bundle
2. Decodes into ETF structs
3. Published to Views via @StateObject
4. Views observe changes and update UI

**No External Dependencies**
- Pure SwiftUI
- Built-in JSON decoding
- Native iOS APIs only
